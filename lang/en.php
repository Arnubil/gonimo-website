     , "What are you?"
     , "I'm a free baby monitor that can be used on any device with a microphone and/or a camera that runs one of the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera or Safari."
     , "What sets you apart from other baby monitors?"
     , "You can use me on a variety of different devices because I work on your browser and because you don't have to install an app. I'm free and you can use all my functions without any restrictions. I also have excellent safety measures built in - so you and your data are as secure as can be."
     , "Can't I just use Skype?"
     , "einfach ein schlechtes Babyphon, genau wie Gonimo ein schlechtes Telefon ist.</li></ul>"
     , "How high is the exposure to radiation while I'm on?"
     , "If the baby station is a meter away from your baby, the exposure is a lot lower than when you talk with your phone at your ear (by about 100.000). So there's no stronger exposure than when Facebook and the likes retrieve information from the internet or when you listen to music via bluetooth headset."
     , "What do I need to use you?"
     , "You need a device that has a microphone and/or a camera and with one of the following browsers installed: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera oder Safari. Depending on how and for how long you use me, eventually you will need to connect me to a power outlet. If you're using audio only, you can easily get through the night without recharging the battery. "
     , "Do I have to pay to use you?"
     , "No!!! Gonimo is an open source project and it's free to use. It's very important to my creators to make my many features available to as many people as possible, easy and free. You can find more information on what exactly open source means <a href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source' title='Wikipedia: Open Source' target='_blank'> &gt here &lt </a>."
     , "Why is there going to be an additional fee-based app?"
     , "The planned fee-based app will offer various features over and above those offered in the web application. Those can only be implemented via an installed app, because  browsers don't have permission to control everything on a device.  "
     , "How much mobile data do you need?"
     , "If both devices are connected to a wifi network, I don't need any mobile data. If you use me with audio only, the data transfer rate is very low. If audio and video streaming are being used simultaneously, depending on the quality of the connection the data volume used up may be high. I recommend you keep an eye on the data usage in this case. "
     , "How safe is the connection between devices?"
     , "To guarantee maximum security, I come with the following safety features: an invitation-based system in which invitations need to be confirmed, and peer-to-peer encryption to prevent third parties from 'listening in'. "
     , "Can I use you as anything other than a baby monitor?"
     , "In principle, my features are intended for use as a baby monitor. Of course, you can use me for other activities that require audio and/or video streaming. "
     , "How is Gonimo financed?"
     , "To get the startup project going and implement the product, NetIdee.at provides us with funding. A native (installable app) is in planning and will be available for a small fee. It will cover features that are not feasible via browser. You can also donate, this would help us a lot and guarantees we can constantly develop and improve."
     , "Is there a way to support you?"
     , "Sure! You can support the Gonimo project by donating via the donate button, by purchasing the fee-based app and/or by liking us on various social media platform. Of course, we are always on the look-out for creative and motivated people who would like to support the project with their ambition and their know-how. "
     , "Will my data be saved or passed on to third parties?"
     , "I save only as much data as is necessary for my features to function. This data is not passed on to third parties under any circumstances and can be deleted from the servers at any time upon your request (form). Audio and/or video data is not saved. Due to the peer-to-peer connection, it is impossible to access from the outside."
     , "Are there minimum hardware specifications to be able to use you?"
     , "You can use any hardware and any device on which the following browsers are installed or installable: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera or Safari."
     , "Who are your creators?"
     , "A team of young, motivated people whose profiles you can find <a href='/team.php' title='Gonimo Team'> &gt here &lt </a>."
     , "If I'd like to start my own project based on the Gonimo code, can I just copy and use the Gonimo source code?"
     , "gomimo.com is an open-source-project and subject to the guidelines of <a href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License' title='GNU LICENSE' target='_blank'>AGPL GNU Affero General Public License</a> which means the <a href='https://github.com/gonimo' title='Source Code' target='_blank'>source code</a> can be used unter the conditions stated."
